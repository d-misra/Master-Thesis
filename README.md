**Title** : Learning to grasp with a jamming gripper using the Black-DROPS algorithm. 

**Brief overview** : A data-efficient reinforcement learning algorithm based on a model-based policy search approach (Black-DROPS https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07261), that uses Gaussian Processes for modelling the uncertain system transition dynamics and noisy black-box function optimizers (CMA-ES) for policy search, is applied for a robotic grasping task. The setup consists of a versaball gripper fit on a 5-dof manipulator. RGBD cameras (Xtion3) are used for the object detection purpose.
